I have encountered the error of "directory not found", because I named the directory as into-programming instead of into-programming. So, when I used the copied code from the assigment page on the site, which ises intro-programming name of a directory I got an error. But luckily I was on my second directory exploration, so it was easy to rename the newly created dir from into-programming to intro-programming using mv command.
